<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week we'll learn how to build web services based on the <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer (REST) architectural style.</p>
<p><span>We'll learn about <strong>Node.js</strong>, a runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. We will also learn about the popular <strong>Express</strong> framework that makes it easy to write web applications and services on top of Node.js.</span></p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-nodejs-and-express">Introduction to Node.js and Express</h3>
<p>In this module, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce Node.js and Express.
<ul>
<li>Discover what Node.js is and what it can and cannot do.</li>
<li>Explore Express and look at why it's a helpful tool to use.</li>
<li>Examine the relationship between Express and Node.js.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>See a high-level overview of the main features of Express.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Learn how to test our Web API using a tool called Postman manually.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Create our first CRUD Web API.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.5em; color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark);">Server-Side Routing with Express</span></p>
<p><span>Node's HTTP server uses a single <code>request handler function</code> for all requests. However, Express provides a way to break the application into different request handlers for each URL + HTTP method combination.</span></p>
<p><span>This feature is called routing and is one of the main features of Express.</span></p>
<p><span>In this module, we will take a more in-depth look at routing. We will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use the routing feature of Express to build several endpoints.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Cover different ways to pass data to a Web API.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Introduce <strong>REST</strong> as a way to guide the architecture of the web.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Use Express Routers to organize our code.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="express-middleware">Express Middleware</h3>
<p><span>Express is a minimalist framework. It doesn't provide everything out of the box, but using middleware can add extra functionality to our application. In addition, using middleware offers a way to extend the features provided by the Express framework.</span></p>
<p><span>They are implemented as small functions that handle one aspect of our application. For example, tasks like authentication and logging are commonly handled by middleware. Another benefit of middleware is that it provides an easy way to add modularity to our code.</span></p>
<h3 id="web-deployment-and-best-practices">Web Deployment and Best Practices</h3>
<p><span>The time has come to show your work to the world. In this module, we'll deploy our application to Heroku. This cloud provider gives several services geared towards helping developers publish their sites on the internet.</span></p>
